# Le concept de la preuve

> `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — both Claude Code and VS Code AI read from `AGENTS.md`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev       # Start dev server
pnpm build     # Production build
pnpm preview   # Preview production build
```

## Tech Stack

- **Astro v5** — static-first framework with hybrid rendering
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — via `@tailwindcss/vite` Vite plugin (NOT the old `@astrojs/tailwind` integration)
- **Netlify** (`@astrojs/netlify`) — deployment adapter with SSR support
- **pnpm** — package manager

## Key Architecture

- Hybrid rendering: static pages by default, `export const prerender = false` for server routes
- Config in `astro.config.mjs` — Netlify adapter + Tailwind via Vite plugin
- Styles in `src/styles/global.css`
- Add integrations with: `pnpm astro add <name>`

## Conventions

- Use `pnpm` (not npm or yarn)
- Prefer Astro integrations and Vite plugins over manual configuration
- Static rendering by default — only opt into SSR for dynamic endpoints
- Tailwind CSS v4 is a Vite plugin, NOT an Astro integration

## Specs (`specs/`)

The `specs/` folder contains specifications, plans, and design documents that guide implementation.

- **Before implementing a feature**: read `specs/README.md` for an index of available specs, then read relevant spec files
- **When brainstorming or planning**: write output to `specs/<NNN>-<name>/plan.md` and update `specs/README.md`
- **When executing a plan**: treat the spec as the source of truth for requirements and acceptance criteria
- Each iteration gets its own folder: `specs/<NNN>-<name>/` containing `plan.md` and any related docs

## Planned Features

- **Astro DB** (`@astrojs/db`) for vote tracking (not yet added)
- Content collections with `glob()` loader for comics
- Vote API at `/api/vote` with cookie-based visitor ID
