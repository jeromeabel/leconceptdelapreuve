## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jeromeabel/lapreuveduconcept.git
cd lapreuveduconcept

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server with local database
ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE=./.astro/data.db npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build with local database (for testing)
ASTRO_DATABASE_FILE=./.astro/data.db npm run build

# Build with remote database (for deployment)
npm run build -- --remote
```

### Database Management

```bash
# Push schema to remote database
npm run db:push

# Seed the database
npm run db:seed
```

## Content Management

Comics are stored as Markdown files in `src/content/comics/` with the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Le Début"
author: "Jean Dupont"
date: 2024-01-15
panel1: "/images/placeholder-1.svg"
panel2: "/images/placeholder-2.svg"
description: "La première aventure commence ici"
---

# Comic content here
```

## Deployment

### Netlify

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Set up environment variables:
   - `ASTRO_STUDIO_APP_TOKEN` (for production database)
3. Build command: `npm run build -- --remote`
4. Publish directory: `dist`

The `netlify.toml` file is already configured for deployment.

## Cookie-Based Voting

The voting system uses HTTP-only cookies to track user votes:

- Each user gets a unique cookie ID
- Votes are stored in the `Votes` table
- User voting history is stored in the `Users` table
- One vote per comic per user
